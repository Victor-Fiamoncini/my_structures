# Linked List

- Linear data-structure
- Elements can be stored as per memory availability
- Can access elements on linear fashion only
- Stores homogeneous elements i.e, similar elements
- Dynamic in size
- Easy insertion and deletion
- Starting element or node is the key which is generally termed as head

## Advantages

- Dynamic in size
- No wastage as capacity and size is always equal
- Easy insertion and deletion as 1 link manipulation is required
- Efficient memory allocation

## Disadvantages

- If head node is lost, linked list is lost
- No random access possible

## Applications

- Suitable where memory is limited
- Suitable for applications that requires frequent insertion and deletion
