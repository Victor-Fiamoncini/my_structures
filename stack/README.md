# Stack

- Linear data-structure
- Follows LIFO: Last in First Out
- Only the top elements is available to be accessed
- Insertion and deletion takes place from the top
- Eg: stack of plates, chairs, etc
- Major operations:
  - push(element) - used to insert element at top
  - pop() - removes the top element
  - isEmpty() - returns true if stack is empty
  - peek() - get the top element
- All operations works in constant time i.e, O(1)

## Advantages

- All operations are of O(1) complexity
- Last element is readily available for use

## Disadvantages

- Not much flexible
- Manipulation is restricted to the top of stack

## Applications

- Recursion
- Parsing
- Browser
- Editors
