# Arrays

- Linear data-structure
- Elements are stored in contiguous memory locations
- Can access elements randomly using index
- Stores homogeneous elements i.e, similar elements

## Advantages

- Random access
- Easy sorting and iteration
- Replacement of multiple variables

## Disadvantages

- Size is fixed
- Difficult to insert and delete
- If capacity is more and occupancy less most of the array gets wasted
- Needs contiguous memory to get allocated

## Applications

- For storing information in linear fashion
- Suitable for applications that requires frequent searching
